# Colon-classifier

**IMPORTANT** This notebook is designed to be ran in google colab, if you do so go through cell by cell rather than running it all - some of the models are quite large, and so are the datasets.

### Project Overview
I have made a notebook that can be easily ran in googlecolab using the free T4 run time for creating classifcation model for a variety of colon-related diesase using medical image data. I create a few models and go through various topics such as transsferred-learning, evelotionary algorithms, CNN architecture, Efficent callback functions, data augmentation in Keras and much more. 

If you happen upon this and are interested in computer vision then perhaps there are some things you will learn by going through, and perhaps running the code for you self. 

The notebook is rather dense and rather huge with content, although I do layout comments and markdown approprtiatly so it should be fairly intuative to follow along with the logic.

## running the notebook in googlecolab

again, it is recomended to run this in colab, although feel free to run it locally if you have sufficent GPU resouce. I would not recommend running this on CPU.

Running this in colab is easily:
  1. Navigate to google colab
  2. select file and then `upload notebook`
  3. select github
  4. Paste in the https github directory i.e `https://github.com/thickett/Colon-classifier.git`
  5. You should see the .ipynb apear select it
  6. Ensure you are on a GPU runtime - you can use t4 for free as of 28/01/2025
